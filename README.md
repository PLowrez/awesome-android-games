A curated list of IAP-free, ad-free games on Android.

Have you ever scrolled through the Google Play store looking for something to play, annoyed that it's hard to sort the quality, lovingly-made and player-oriented titles from the swathes of garbage that just want to feed you ads at every available opportunity, those that only pray at the alter of DAU and CTR?

Well this list is for you. These are games designed to be enjoyed, first and foremost. Some are free, delivered as a gift to the world like open-source free (not as in beer) software. Some are paid, like it was 1995 and a new SNES game just came out.

_The list is tiny right now! Submit games via pull requests or just shoot me an email: matthewhayter at, (go away bots) gmail._

* [MiniSweeper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AntonBergaker.minisweeper) - Free - A minesweeper clone, with bonus battery-optimisations.
* [Mini Metro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.codepoint.minimetro) - Paid - _Mini Metro is a game about designing a subway map for a growing city. Draw lines between stations and start your trains running. As new stations open, redraw your lines to keep them efficient. Decide where to use your limited resources. How long can you keep the city moving?_
